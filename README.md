# analyzing_covid_data
The goal of this is to create three SQL queries and describe the insights/implications the results yield. 
1. The total number of PCR tests performed as of yesterday in the United States.
2. The 7-day rolling average number of new cases per day for the last 30 days.
3. The 10 states with the highest test positivity rate (positive tests / tests performed) for tests performed in the last 30 days.
