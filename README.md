# analyzing_covid_data
The goal of this is to create three SQL queries and describe the insights/implications the results yield. 
1. The total number of PCR tests performed as of yesterday in the United States.
2. The 7-day rolling average number of new cases per day for the last 30 days.
3. The 10 states with the highest test positivity rate (positive tests / tests performed) for tests performed in the last 30 days.
A few caveats: - When the data was downloaded from the website the most recent date was 5/9. So the last 30 days looked at are from 4/9 to 5/9 and the PCR tests as of 5/9 were looked at. I have attached a copy of the dataset downloaded from the source which I performed the querying on, as there may be more, newer data ammended since then.
